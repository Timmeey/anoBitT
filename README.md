This is a Bachelor Thesis Project.
It is intended to enable social groups to use completely decentralized P2P Filesharing (nothing special), while also enable anonymous access to "public" files from other social groups, via the TOR network and hidden services.

This Project uses a lib from a local maven repository. The source can be found at https://github.com/Timmeey/libJava
